# PythonHTTPServer

An http webserver based the python socket module.



## Dependencies

You need to have Python Version 3.6 or higher installed to run this program.

All other dependencies for PythonHTTPServer are part of the default python install and therefore do not need to be installed separately. Those being the modules:

- ssl
- socket
- threading
- json
- sys
- os 



## Configuration

For now configuring the program is done by manipulating the top portion of the server.py file itself. This will be changed later on though.



## Execution

You can start the webserver by just executing the server.py file. Either through double clicking it or typing 

```
sudo python3 server.py
```

into the terminal whilst inside its directory.
